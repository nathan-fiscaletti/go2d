## Running a Go2D Game

If you are only trying to **run** a game that was created using Go2D, you will need to install SDL.

See [Installing SDL](./sdl.md) for more information on installing SDL for your particular system.

## Demos

There are two Demos packaged with Go2D which demonstrate the use of some of it's data structures.

* [Pong](./pong): A basic example of the classic game of Pong with a mild twist where the paddles shrink in size each time the ball collides with them.

* [Shooter](./shooter): A simple Shooter game where balls will spawn at the top and you can shoot them by pressing the space bar.
